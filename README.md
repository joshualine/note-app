Build me a Notes App,  using .txt files to represent each note.

*Requirements:*
1. I should be able to Create, Read,  Update and Delete a note(s).
These notes will be *.txt* files, so acquaint yourselves with handling files using NodeJS.
2. I need to see these endpoints on your backend / API:
a. */create*
b. */read*
c. */update*
d. */delete*
3. Host it on heroku.com or repl.it, whatever works and lets you access their file system

Additional Info:
1. Do not use any backend framework!! (Expressjs, etc), but you can use a frontend framework if you like
2. While I would appreciate a decent UI, it's not a requirement, I just need to see a note taking app that matches my requirements.
3. A monolith app or microservice architecture, use any one - your choice.
4. I will check and review your backend code, only if you submit on time

Bonus points:
1. I can search for notes that match a string that I type in.
API can have a */search* endpoint for example.
2. Any fancy feature you think is worth it.

*Deadline:*
You have till Thursday Night - 11:59PM *Max*.
Start ASAP, I promise you, you will not have time or finish it sharp sharp if you delay.
There's a prize for those that make it in time :wink:
and for those that impress me.It's time to try and impress me.
Goodluck! :+1:
